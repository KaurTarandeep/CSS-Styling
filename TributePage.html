    <div class="content">
      <p>Bhagat Singh was born into a Punjabi Sikh family on 27 September 1907[1] in the village of Banga in the
        Lyallpur district of the Punjab in what was then British India and is today Pakistan; he was the second of seven
        children—four sons, and three daughters—born to Vidyavati and her husband Kishan Singh Sandhu.[16] Bhagat
        Singh's father and his uncle Ajit Singh were active in progressive politics, taking part in the agitation around
        the Canal Colonization Bill in 1907, and later the Ghadar Movement of 1914–1915.[16]

        After being sent to the village school in Banga for a few years, Bhagat Singh was enrolled in the Dayanand
        Anglo-Vedic School in Lahore.[16] In 1923, he joined the National College in Lahore, founded two years earlier
        by Lala Lajpat Rai in response to Mahatma Gandhi's non-cooperation movement, which urged Indian students to shun
        schools and colleges subsidized by the British Indian government.[16]

        Police became concerned with Singh's influence on youths and arrested him in May 1927 on the pretext that he had
        been involved in a bombing that had taken place in Lahore in October 1926. He was released on a surety of Rs.
        60,000 five weeks after his arrest.[17] He wrote for, and edited, Urdu and Punjabi newspapers, published in
        Amritsar[18] and also contributed to low-priced pamphlets published by the Naujawan Bharat Sabha that excoriated
        the British.[19] He also wrote for Kirti, the journal of the Kirti Kisan Party ("Workers and Peasants Party")
        and briefly for the Veer Arjun newspaper, published in Delhi.[20][a] He often used pseudonyms, including names
        such as Balwant, Ranjit and Vidhrohi.[22]

        Bhagat Singh (27 September 1907[1] – 23 March 1931) was a charismatic Indian revolutionary[3] who participated
        in the mistaken murder of a junior British police officer[4] in what was to be retaliation for the death of an
        Indian nationalist.[5] He later took part in a largely symbolic bombing of the Central Legislative Assembly in
        Delhi and a hunger strike in jail, which—on the back of sympathetic coverage in Indian-owned newspapers—turned
        him into a household name in the Punjab region, and after his execution at age 23 into a martyr and folk hero in
        Northern India.[6] Borrowing ideas from Bolshevism and anarchism,[7] he electrified a growing militancy in India
        in the 1930s, and prompted urgent introspection within the Indian National Congress's nonviolent but eventually
        successful campaign for India's independence.[8]

        In December 1928, Bhagat Singh and an associate, Shivaram Rajguru, both members of a small revolutionary group,
        the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (also Army, or HSRA), shot dead a 21-year-old British police
        officer, John Saunders, in Lahore, Punjab, in what is today Pakistan, mistaking Saunders, who was still on
        probation, for the British senior police superintendent, James Scott, whom they had intended to assassinate.[9]
        They held Scott responsible for the death of a popular Indian nationalist leader Lala Lajpat Rai for having
        ordered a lathi (baton) charge in which Rai was injured and two weeks thereafter died of a heart attack. As
        Saunders exited a police station on a motorcycle, he was felled by a single bullet fired from across the street
        by Rajguru, a marksman.[10][11] As he lay injured, he was shot at close range several times by Singh, the
        postmortem report showing eight bullet wounds.[12] Another associate of Singh, Chandra Shekhar Azad, shot dead
        an Indian police head constable, Channan Singh, who attempted to give chase as Singh and Rajguru fled.
